# Introduction

The Center for Applied Mathematics was created in 1964 “to encourage
the application of mathematical knowledge in the physical, biological,
and social sciences.”  The first director was Bill Sears, an
aerodynamicist educated under von Karman at Caltech, who was returning
to academia after time spent in industry at Northrup.  The center
started with 20 members from math, engineering, physics, and
chemistry.  Today, we have over a hundred members, from an even
broader array of disciplines, but still are guided by that original
mission of encouraging the application of mathematical knowledge
across a wide range of disciplines.

The range of possibilities for graduate study encompasses the areas of
specialization of all of the faculty members in the field, who currently
number more than one hundred. The faculty members are drawn from
fourteen departments in the College of Engineering, the College of
Arts and Sciences, the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and
the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management. There is
opportunity for further diversification on the choice of minor
subjects.

Graduate students are admitted to the Field of Applied Mathematics
from a variety of educational backgrounds that have a strong
mathematics component. Generally, only students who wish to become
candidates for the Doctor of Philosophy Degree are considered. About
40-50 students are enrolled in the program, which usually requires
4-6 years to complete.

# Program timeline and milestones

A PhD in Applied Mathematics typically takes 4-6 years depending on
several factors. These factors include the level of preparation prior
to beginning the program, graduate committee recommendations,
motivation to end graduate study quickly, and faculty availability,
among other issues.  Students begin their program with
primarily taking classes and end it with primarily research, with the
years in between being a mix of the two. During the first two years a
student typically takes two or three classes a semester.

Five years is the average time period for completion of PhD, with many
students continuing into their sixth year. Below is a time table based
on five years.

## Year 1

Take classes both semesters.  A normal course load for a beginning
graduate student is three courses per term.

Begin to consider who you would like to ask to be on your Graduate Committee.

Before you arrive in the fall, you will have been assigned a temporary
advisor. Choose your first semester courses after meeting with your
temporary advisor.

Ideally, you should select an advisor to replace your temporary one in
the spring. Choose this faculty member with the idea that this person
will likely be your Committee Chair for your Graduate Committee.

## Year 2

Take classes both semesters.

By the end of your fall semester, you must have chosen your full
committee (minimum of three members including your Chair). You will
need to submit this request online in Student Center. Your advisor,
the DGS, and GFA will receive an email to sign off on the
request. Begin exploring research topics for the coming spring and/or
summer.

During the spring semester your research should now be underway.

## Year 3

Prepare for the Admissions to Candidacy (A) exam and consult with your
Chair which classes you should be taking before becoming more involved
in research. During the spring or summer (must be before semester 7
begins) you must take the A exam.

## Year 4

Research and finish up any remaining classes.

Begin thinking about and pursuing employment opportunities.

## Year 5

Research.

Actively pursue employment opportunities during the fall
semester. Don’t wait until spring to start! Take the B exam (thesis
defense).

# First-Year Mentoring

The first year of graduate school is a critical period for students as
they learn to navigate Cornell and to manage competing demands from
coursework, research, and teaching duties.  In addition to the
start-of-year orientation activities, first-year students are matched
with both faculty and peer mentors who can help provide guidance
throughout the year.

## First-Year Faculty Advising

All first-year graduate students are formally advised by the CAM
director.  This means that the CAM director is responsible for signing
the "advisor" slot in any university forms that a first-year student
might need signed.  CAM students (first year and beyond) are also
welcome to come to the director to ask questions or seek advice.

Beyond the director, each incoming CAM student is assigned a
provisional advisor for the first year.  The provisional advisor
should check in with the student at least twice a semester until the
student finds a permanent advisor (which may or may not be the
provisional advisor).  Some topics of discussion for these meetings
might include:

 - Course selection
 - Time management
 - Seminars and colloquiua
 - Applying for fellowships
 - Seeking advisors
 - TA duties
 - Adjusting to life in Ithaca
 - Physical and mental health
 - Relating to other students
 - Any concerning behavior encountered (unethical behavior, biased speech)

For mental health resources we have CAPS (counseling and psychological
services in Gannett Health Center), EARS (peer counseling), and Let's
Talk (drop-in consultation; the nearest is in Sage Hall Thursdays
2:30-4:30pm).  And for any concerns about unethical behavior, biased
speech, etc, resources students should know about are the Office of
Institutional Equity and Title IX, Office of the University Ombudsman
(<www.ombudsman.cornell.edu>) and the bias reporting center (255-1426,
`report_bias@cornell.edu`).

## Peer Mentoring Program

The Peer Mentoring Program offers formal support to CAM students in
their first year by pairing them with established CAM students who can
help them navigate their transition into CAM. First-year students are
matched with one or two peer mentors before the beginning of their
first semester. The role of the mentors is to enhance the first-year
experience by providing support, encouragement and information to
their mentees. Mentors may have suggestions about work-life balance,
adjusting to life in CAM or Cornell, advisor/advisee relationships and
more. Mentors may serve as both personal and professional support for
their mentees. In addition, Peer Mentor Program group events are held
throughout the year and include fun activities as well as practical
workshops.

Over the summer, a match-up survey is sent out to all incoming CAM
students and to prospective peer mentors. In mid-August a welcome
email is sent out to mentors and mentees with their matches. Mentors
and mentees meet throughout the year, and larger group activities are
organized 1-2 times per semester. After each semester, a feedback
survey is sent to mentors and mentees. Questions or comments can be
sent to the program coordinators

### Peer Mentor Expectations

- Make a good faith effort to meet with your mentee in-person at least
  once per semester.
- Attend at least one group activity per semester.
- Direct your mentee to the Director of Graduate Studies (David
  Bindel) or the Administrative Manager (Erika Fowler-Decatur) for
  answers to questions you cannot answer.
- Check in on your mentee’s morale and progress or goals, both
  academic and research-related, at least twice per semester.
- Facilitate connections and build community between your mentee and
  other graduate students and faculty when appropriate.
- Respond to your mentees and the mentoring program coordinators in a
  timely fashion.

### Peer Mentee Expectations

- Make a good faith effort to meet with your mentor in-person at least
  once per semester.
- Attend at least two group activities per semester.
- View your mentor as your go-to person for questions or concerns but
  also feel free to reach out to other CAM students.
- Respond to your mentors and the mentoring program coordinators in a
  timely fashion.

# Forming the Special Committee

A committee chair (thesis advisor) must be selected by each
Ph.D. student before the end of the second semester (i.e., before the
end of Academic Year 1).  Students are then expected to select a
permanent full committee by the end of the third semester. Students
submit a "Special Committee Change and Selection Form" to the Graduate
School to indicate their selection. Students may change committee
members at any time by submitting a new form to the Graduate
School. However, if they are post A-exam or three months within
Ph.D. exam (B-exam), they must petition.  Exceptions to the above
requirements must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies
(DGS).

The Special Committee consists of a Chair/thesis advisor and at least
one member for each of two minor subjects. One of the minor subjects
must be mathematics. The other minor field can be from any area chosen
by the student that is relevant to their doctoral research.

## Finding a permanent advisor

Because applied math is an “orphan" graduate field without an
associated a department, the faculty affiliated with applied math
have a wide range of departmental homes; and our PhD students are
integrated with exciting initiatives across campus in biology,
engineering, computing, finance, and more.  Because our PhD program
touches so much of campus, choosing an advisor can be an intimidating
task!  Fortunately, there are several formal and informal mechanisms
to help students find an appropriate advisor:

- *Discussion with faculty mentors*: The director and the provisional
  advisor are meant to serve as a resource for students looking for
  possible advisors.  In many cases, faculty members may have some
  idea who is looking for students (and who is not), and can help
  point a student to a few prospective matches.
- *Discussion with CAM students*: The first-year mentors and other CAM
  students often know how field members have worked out as advisors
  for other students, and can be a valuable source of information.
- *Bill Sears Blitz*: The Center has a fall poster session and "blitz
  session" of one minute talks from students and faculty about their
  current research.  This can be a good opportunity for new students
  to learn about prospective advisors (and vice-versa), as well as
  giving older students a peek into the broader CAM research portfolio.
- *CAM events*: Students and faculty have opportunities to socialize
  at post-colloquium refreshments, picnics, and other CAM events.
- *Classes and seminars*: One standard way that students get involved
  in research is to take a class from a prospective advisor, or to get
  to know a prospective advisor from interactions in a colloquium or
  area seminar.
- *Knocking on doors*: Even without any other excuses for interacting,
  it's possible to send an email to a faculty member expressing
  interest in their research! If the email gets ignored, it's also
  possible for a student to show up at the faculty's office
  (particularly if it is during advertised office hours).

Finding a good advising match is important, and it takes time.  It is
fine not to match advisors immediately, and it is fine not to work
with the first advisor attempted.  Cornell provides extensions to give
students a way to take the time they need --- but at the same time,
it's best not to delay the search too much!

## Special committee constitution

The committee chair will aid the graduate student in selecting a
Special Committee, which shall consist of a minimum of three faculty
members and which will directly supervise the graduate study and
research of a student. The committee chair, who is also the thesis
advisor, represents the major field of applied mathematics. The other
faculty members represent two minor fields; one of these must be
mathematics and the other is a field outside mathematics. This
committee must be formed before the end of the third semester.

A Special Committee Selection and Change form must be submitted to the
Graduate School to establish a committee or change/add committee
members. This can be done online through Student Center.

Selection of a Special Committee (including the thesis advisor) is a
mutual agreement between a student, the chosen faculty members and the
DGS. During the pursuit of the degree, changes in circumstances may
cause the student and/or faculty members to desire the termination of
this commitment.  Students may make changes to their special committee
any time before the A exam; changes after an A exam require special
approval.

Different students have different levels of engagement with their
special committees.  The field of applied math does not require any
formal meetings of the committee except at A exams and B exams, and
some students have little interaction with their committee members
outside of these exams.  For other students, the committee members may
act as collaborators or co-advisors, helping jointly mentor the
student along with the thesis committee chair.

## Mentoring beyond your committee

Your advisor may be an important mentor on the path through graduate
school, but you will ideally have other mentors as well.  Different
mentors can provide different perspectives and functions in your life:
from broadening your research network, to helping you become a better
teacher, to helping you define your future career goals.  You will
want to form relationships with faculty members who can recommend you
for positions, senior students who can help you navigate Cornell and
CAM, postdocs who can provide another perspective from their own PhD
experiences, and others.  Your advisor and special committee play
an important formal role in guiding you through the PhD program, but
it is worthwhile cultivating a broader network of mentors beyond your
committee as well.

# A and B exams

To be admitted formally to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree, the student
must pass the oral admission to candidacy examination or A exam. This
must be completed before the beginning of the student's seventh
semester.  The admission to candidacy examination is given to
determine if the student is "ready to begin work on a thesis." The
content and methods of examination are agreed on by the student and
his/her committee before the examination. The student must be prepared
to answer questions on the proposed area of research, and to pass the
exam, he/she must demonstrate expertise beyond just mastery of basic
mathematics covered in the standard first-year graduate courses.

The A-Exam should be scheduled well in advance of the exam and the
appropriate form (Schedule of Examination form) MUST be submitted to
the Graduate School at least 7 calendar days ahead. CAM graduate
students are eligible for a Non-Thesis Masters Degree upon completion
of the A-Exam. In order for this to be awarded, the Committee Chair
must check the relevant box on the Results of Examination Form. The
form must be turned into the Graduate School within 3 days after the
exam.

The candidate must write a thesis that represents creative work and
contains original results in that area. The research is carried on
independently by the candidate under the supervision of the
chairperson of the Special Committee. When the thesis is completed,
the student presents his/her results at the thesis defense or B exam.
The B-Exam (thesis defense) is scheduled with the same form as the
A-Exam and must be submitted to the Grad School at least 7 calendar
days ahead.

# Courses

A normal course load for a beginning graduate student is two or three
courses per term.  The Director of Graduate Studies in conjunction
with the student's temporary committee chair will assist first-year
students in determining the appropriate courses to meet individual
needs.  All requirement courses must be taken for a letter grade.

## Enrollment expectations

Students on ordinary status (e.g.~not on leave of absence) are
required to enroll in a minimum of 12 credits per semester.  Students
not enrolled in sufficient courses must be enrolled for research using
either Graduate School or, if available, departmental course numbers
assigned for that purpose.  Graduate School research courses will be
automatically adjusted at the end of the grop period to bring total
credits to 12.

## Prerequisite Courses

Prerequisite to the graduate program are familiarity with analysis and
algebra at the advanced undergraduate level (e.g., MATH 4130-4140 and
MATH 4330-4340). Students lacking either prerequisite (which may be
determined by their special committee chair and/or the CAM Director of
Graduate Studies), should take the appropriate courses within their
first two years of study. No more than two of these courses can count
towards meeting other CAM degree requirements.

## Responsible Conduct in Research (RCR)

Every graduate student is required to complete a 
[short course on Responsible Conduct of Research](https://oria.cornell.edu/rcr/lookup/foundational/), to be finished by the end of the second
registered semester.  This online training addresses issues of
authorship, peer review, plagiarism, and research misconduct.
Students who are supported on NSF funding are required to take a
[longer course on RCR](https://oria.cornell.edu/rcr/lookup/) within 60 days of the start of the support period.

## CAM Core Courses

For advancement to candidacy, students are required to take at least
eight courses in mathematics and its applications that are approved by
her/his special committee, at least 4 of which must be numbered 6000
or above. Suggested areas for these courses are given in the list of
Focal Areas for Applied Mathematics.  The courses must include an
advanced course in computational methods (focal area (a)). In order to
achieve breadth in Applied Mathematics, courses from at least three
other Focal Areas should normally be included. Should a course be
listed under more than one focal area, then it will count towards only
one such area as chosen by the student's Special Committee.

The program allows great flexibility in the selection of courses. Most
students design their own course sequences, subject to requirements,
to meet their own interests. Courses are typically chosen from the
math department and many applications departments

The seven major Focal Areas for the field of applied mathematics are
listed below, along with examples of recommended courses for
completing the requirements in each focal area. In addition to the
listed example courses, appropriate courses containing substantial
mathematical content, offered by any department, may be taken to
satisfy field requirements in mathematics and its applications,
subject to approval by the student's Special Committee.

## Minor requirements

Students are required to have minors in Mathematics and in another
field relevant to their doctoral research. Note that the course
requirements listed above may suffice to satisfy the requirements for
a graduate minor in Mathematics.

## Note on eligible courses

The NY State Education Department policy indicates that

> Credit toward an graduate degree shall be earned only through work
> designed expressly for graduate students.  Enrollment ... of
> undergraudates in graduate courses, and of graduate students in
> undergraduate courses shall be strictly controlled by the institution.

Some CAM focal area courses will be offered with both 4000-level and
5000-level versions going forward, including MATH 4410-4420, MATH
4250-4260 (crosslisted as CS 4210-4220), and MATH 4210.  The
5000-level versions Because of this policy, beginning in Fall 2021,
courses taken to fulfill CAM requirements must be taken with the
*graduate* course number (5000+).

# Life at the center

CAM today is a center of several applied math activities on campus.
The core of the center is the graduate field of applied mathematics.
But we also have a postdoc program, meant to foster interdisciplinary
applied math collaborations across campus, and a colloquium series
that brings a wide variety of applied mathematicians to campus.  The
physical heart of the program is a space on the sixth floor of Rhodes
Hall where all our PhD students and postdocs have their desks.

## CAM space

Each student is guaranteed an individual cubicle in a shared work
space environment. This set up allows for more collaboration and
mentoring among students while giving a space to work and store your
materials.

CAM has several shared workstations in Rhodes 657 that have relevant
software. Color and black and white printers are also available on the
shared workstations. Students also have access to other computers in
computer labs on campus, and especially Rhodes Hall. Print jobs with
more difficult requirements can be accommodated by working with
departmental staff.

## Colloquium

The applied math colloquium meets on Fridays from 3:30-4:30, with
refreshments in the CAM space afterward.  The colloquium usually (but
not always) meets in Rhodes 657.  The talks cover a wide range of
applied mathematics, and are meant to be accessible to a broad applied
math audience.  Students are encouraged to show up even for talks
outside their immediate interest!

In addition to the talk, speakers are invited to have lunch with the
students (funded by CAM). The lunch meeting is not open to other
faculty, and is meant to give students the chance to have a candid
conversation with the speaker about mathematics, mathematical careers,
and life more generally.

## Bill Sears Blitz

The Bill Sears Blitz slide and poster session is an opportunity for
CAM faculty and students and community members to mingle and learn
about all the interesting things that CAM members are doing.
Presenters are welcome to give a poster and/or a one-minute one-slide
summary in a "poster blitz" talk or give a slide in the blitz session.
This event takes place in the fall semester, and is meant both as a
way for new students to learn about prospective advisors and for the
rest of CAM to keep up with what is going on in the center.

## SIAM Student Chapter

CAM is home to Cornell's student chapter of the [Society for Industrial
and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)](https://www.siam.org/).  As members
of the SIAM student chapter, students are also eligible to [free SIAM
student
membership](https://www.siam.org/membership/join-siam/individual-members/student).

## Other Events

Throughout the year, CAM offers a number of social events for students
and faculty, including fall and spring picnics, a holiday celebration,
orientation for new students, and a graduation ceremony.  In addition
to formal CAM events, the CAM students also organize a variety of
events, including a coffee hour, the informal "CAM Colloquiually"
student seminar series, and others.  CAM students also frequently
attend seminars and colloquiua held in peer units across campus, from
mathematics to mechanical engineering.

# Funding

All full-time students in Applied Mathematics receive a full support
package and are guaranteed five years of funding, subject to
satisfactory academic progress. Upon availability, students in their
sixth year are also funded. CAM does not admit students who are
self-funded. Please contact the CAM office for any questions or
clarifications.

It is important to note that while students are guaranteed funding for
five years, the form of support may vary. Due to CAM's
interdisciplinary nature and faculty field structure, the actual
dollars of guaranteed support often come from different departments
across campus. This arrangement allows students to work closely with
faculty, lab clusters, and students from different disciplines while
still maintaining a home in CAM. For example, a student may hold a
Teaching Assistant (TA) position for two years in Math, a Graduate
Research Assistant (GRA) position for two years in Computer Science
and a final year be on a Graduate School fellowship. While the funding
comes from different sources, the student has received the guaranteed
five years of support.

## What funding covers

All full-time students receive a support package that includes the
following:

### Tuition

Fall and spring tuition is directly paid by the department supporting
the student. The student is not responsible for any charge or duty in
this process. The current tuition amount can be found on the Graduate
School web site.

### [Student Health Plan (SHP)](https://studenthealthbenefits.cornell.edu/health-plans/shp)

The SHP premium is paid on a yearly basis by the department(s)
supporting the student. The student is not responsible for any charge
or duty in the process. Information may be found on the SHP web
site. Please note that only the student's health plan is covered in
the support package. Optional [dental and vision
plans](https://studenthealthbenefits.cornell.edu/dental-vision-plans)
are available, but are not included as a part of SHP.  Spousal/family
insurance is available, but is the responsibility of the student. The
student is also responsible for any copays or deductibles incurred as
a result of using services while on the plan.

### Stipend

All full-time students receive a competitive academic year
stipend. Payment amounts vary according to the funding source, as does
the payment schedule. All admitted students are informed of the amount
of funding (pre-tax) for their first year in their admission
letter. Subsequent years of funding may increase or decrease depending
on the funding source. The amount you receive after taxes depends on
your individual circumstances. All international students are required
to obtain an American social security card directly after having
arrived in the United States in order to receive their
stipend. Cornell University also offers free direct deposit into your
bank account.

## Types of funding

There are typically three types of funding sources: fellowships,
Teaching Assistantships (TA), and Graduate Research Assistantships
(GRA). All three cover the above components described in a support
package. However, stipend amounts and payment schedules will vary.

### Fellowships

Fellowships are highly desirable because they do not carry an extra
work/effort requirement. There are numerous types of fellowships
available, with most being competitive. There exists a number of
fellowships awarded by external to Cornell organizations, such as
National Science Foundation, Departments of Energy, Defense and
Homeland Security, and others. CAM awards the prestigious Presidential
fellowship to two new students every year at the discretion of the
Admissions Committee. The Cornell Graduate School also offers a number
of fellowships according to certain criteria. Whenever possible, the
Admissions Committee (for new students) and CAM faculty and advisors
(for current students) nominate appropriate candidates for these
competitive fellowships. Fellowship stipends are typically paid in two
lump sums divided between the Fall and Spring semesters.

### Teaching Assistantships (TAs)

A TA is responsible for assisting a faculty member in administering a
class. Duties could include grading, managing a course web site,
leading discussion sections, holding office hours, etc. There is a
maximum limit to the number of hours a student can be expected to
devote to their duties. Please consult the Cornell Policy on Graduate
Assistantships for further details and expectations. TA positions are
a very valuable piece of a student's experience. Being a TA helps
reinforce knowledge of material and is a very attractive item to
colleges and universities when considering job applicants in academia,
especially for tenure track positions. While TA positions require
additional work, they have a large payoff and many students very much
enjoy helping others learn and become more confident in
mathematics. Stipends are typically paid in bi weekly paychecks.

### Graduate Research Assistantships (GRAs)

A GRA position allows a student to undertake research under the
direction of a faculty member, usually the Committee Chair. Such a
position allows a student to gain invaluable research experience that
is helpful for their dissertation research and for finding a research
or academic oriented position after earning the PhD. Stipends are
typically paid in bi weekly paychecks.

## Outside employment

Students with a university-funded fellowship, external fellowship, or
GRA position may accept employment of no more than eight hours per
week, if allowed in the terms of the fellowship.  Students working as
TAs may work up to five hours per week, so long as the combined hours
of the assistantship and work do not exceed 20 hours per week.

## Summer support options

There is no tuition charged if a student enrolls in research over the
summer (June-August). However, the student is responsible for tuition
if they enroll in a class and are expecting to receive a residency
unit. CAM is not able to guarantee summer funding, though most
students receive summer funding as a GRA or TA depending on faculty
support.

## Conference and travel grants

The Graduate School offers limited funding for presenting at
conferences or undertaking research in other locations. Please refer
to the Graduate School web site for details and procedures.

# Administrative matters

The graduate field of Applied Mathematics is part of CAM; but, as with
all graduate fields at Cornell, is administratively a part of the
Graduate School.  Many graduate fields are embedded in
departments and colleges and interact with the broader leadership
(the chairs and deans) of those units.
Though CAM cooperates with several other colleges and their
departments to provide funding for TA lines and postdoctoral scholars,
it does not belong to any of Cornell's colleges.  Instead, it is one
of the centers governed by Cornell's
[Office of the Vice Provost for Research and Innovation
(OVPRI)](https://researchservices.cornell.edu/offices/ovpr).  Hence,
most "local" administration that CAM students will see involves the
CAM director and administrative manager.

The CAM Director (David Bindel) also serves as the Director of
Graduate Studies (DGS) for the field of applied mathematics.  Erika
Fowler-Decatur serves as the Graduate Field Assistant (GFA).  The GFA
and DGS manage the affairs of the field and sign graduate student
forms and petitions, as well as serving as the first point of contact
between students and the Graduate School.  The CAM administration is
also generally the first point of contact between graduate students
and the other academic units on campus, such as the departments that
provide TA lines for CAM students.

## Residency and leave

To receive an advanced degree a student must fulfill the residence
requirements of the Graduate School. One unit of residence is granted
for successful completion of one semester of full-time study, as
judged by the chair of the Special Committee. The Ph.D. program
requires a minimum of six residence units. This is not a difficult
requirement to satisfy since the program generally takes four to five
years to complete. A student who has done graduate work at another
institution may petition to transfer residence credit but may not
receive more than two such credits.

Students may request leave of absence status during their program for
a variety of reasons, whether personal (e.g. health reasons),
professional (e.g. internships), or administrative (e.g. students working after filing
their dissertation, but before conferral).  Health leaves are
available up to a maximum of four years; personal leaves are for up to
12 months, renewable for a maximum of four years.
Parental accommodations are also available in the form of either six
weeks of paid accommodation (eight weeks for the birth mother for a
C-section) OR up to two semesters of reduced load status, depending on
circumstances.

In absentia status is available for students conducting approved
research 100 miles or more away from the Cornell campus while under
the guidance of the special committee.  This sometimes happens, for
example, when students move with an advisor to a different institution
(whether the move is permanent or for a sabbatical).  To be eligible,
students must first have completed two semesters of registation at a
Cornell campus.

## The Student Progress Review

The Student Progress Review (SPR) is an annual exchange of written
feedback where advisees are asked to reflect on recent
accomplishments, identify challenges, and set goals.  Committee chairs
then review their students' SPR forms and give constructive feedback.
Chairs may rate student progress as excellent, satisfactory, needs
improvement, or unsatisfactory.  The SPR document is available to the
student, the special committee, and the DGS and GFA.

The SPR is required even if advisors already communicate on a regular
basis. For students who usually only talk to their advisors about
research, the SPR can be an opportunity to have a conversation both
about progress through the program and about broader career goals.

## Academic standing

Students are expected to meet graduate school milestones or work
through approved petition processes.  Students who have formed a
special committee are also expected to meet the expectations of their
committee.

When a committee chair deems a student's progress less than
satisfactory on the SPR (either "Needs Improvement" or
"Unsatisfactory"), the DGS will work with the student and the advisor
on a plan to address issues.

Students who receive an "Unsatisfactory" rating on their SPR have made
little or no progress in the preceding one or two semesters, and are
not considered to be in good academic standing with the Graduate
School.  In this case, the DGS will work with the student, advisor,
and Graduate School on a detailed improvement plan, which is approved
by (and then enforced by) the graduate school.

## Petitions and other forms

Petitions and other forms are [available from the graduate school web
site](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/forms/).  These forms include
standard processes used by every student (scheduling exams and
registering the results of those exams, filing a dissertation), as
well as petitions for change of status or for extensions on program
milestones.  For guidance on graduate school petitions and forms,
students should communicate with the GFA (Erika Fowler-Decatur).

# Other Cornell resources

The [Graduate School web page](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/) has a
wealth of information for prospective and current students.  In
particular, the [Graduate School resources
page](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/resources/) has pointers to
numerous resources around Cornell for academics, health and wellness,
safety, managing as an international student, student life, etc.
